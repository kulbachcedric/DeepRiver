## Summary

Machine learning algorithms enhance and expedite decision-making processes based on available data.
However, as data evolves over time, it becomes crucial to adapt machine learning (ML) systems incrementally to accommodate new data patterns.
This adaptation is achieved through online learning or continuous ML technologies.
Although deep learning technologies have demonstrated outstanding performance on predefined datasets, their application to online, streaming, and continuous learning scenarios has been limited.

`DeepRiver`[@githubGitHubOnlinemldeepriver] is a Python package for deep learning on data streams.
Built on top of River[@montiel2021river] and PyTorch[@paszke2017automatic], it offers a unified API for both supervised and unsupervised learning.
Additionally, it provides a suite of tools for preprocessing data streams and evaluating deep learning models.

# Statement of need

In today's rapidly evolving landscape, machine learning (ML) algorithms play a pivotal role in shaping decision-making processes based on available data.
The acceleration facilitated by these algorithms necessitates constant adaptation to evolving data structures, as what is valid at one moment may no longer hold in the future.
To address this imperative, adopting online learning and continuous ML technologies becomes paramount.
While deep learning technologies have demonstrated exceptional performance on static, predefined datasets, their application to dynamic and continuously evolving data streams remains underexplored.
The absence of widespread integration of deep learning into online, streaming, and continuous learning scenarios hampers the full potential of these advanced algorithms in real-time decision-making [@kulbach2024retrospectivetutorialopportunitieschallenges].
The emergence of the `DeepRiver`[@githubGitHubOnlinemldeepriver] Python package fills a critical void in the field of deep learning on data streams.
Leveraging the capabilities of River[@montiel2021river] and PyTorch[@paszke2017automatic], `DeepRiver` offers a unified API for both supervised and unsupervised learning, providing a seamless bridge between cutting-edge deep learning techniques and the challenges posed by dynamic data streams.
Moreover, the package equips practitioners with essential tools for data stream preprocessing and the evaluation of deep learning models in dynamic, real-time environments.
This was already made use of in the context of Streaming Anomaly Detection [@cazzonelli2022detecting].
As the demand for effective and efficient adaptation of machine learning systems to evolving data structures continues to grow, the integration of `DeepRiver` into the landscape becomes crucial.
This package stands as a valuable asset, unlocking the potential for deep learning technologies to excel in online, streaming, and continuous learning scenarios.
The need for such advancements is evident in the quest to harness the full power of machine learning in dynamically changing environments, ensuring our decision-making processes remain accurate, relevant, and agile in the face of evolving data landscapes.

# Related Work

Online machine learning involves updating models incrementally as new data arrives, rather than retraining models from scratch. 
Several frameworks and libraries have been developed to support this paradigm:

* scikit-multiflow [@10.5555/3291125.3309634]
    * Python-based Library: Inspired by the Java-based MOA framework, designed for streaming data and online learning in Python. 
    * Key Features:
      * Supports algorithms like Hoeffding Trees, online bagging, and boosting. 
      * Includes concept drift detection (e.g., ADWIN, Page-Hinkley) to adapt to changing data distributions. 
      * Stream generators and evaluators for real-time data simulation and model assessment. 
    * Limitations: Focuses mainly on traditional machine learning methods, with limited support for deep learning architectures.
* creme [@creme]
  * Lightweight Online Learning: Specialized in incremental learning where models are updated per instance, leading to efficient, low-latency model training.
  * Provides a unified API with a broad range of online learning algorithms, making it the go-to library for streaming data analysis in Python.
  Limitations: Primarily supports feature-based models with limited capabilities for deep neural networks.

In 2020, creme merged with scikit-multiflow to create River, combining the strengths of both frameworks.

  * Massive Online Analysis (MOA) [@10.5555/1756006.1859903]
    * Java-based Pioneer: One of the earliest frameworks dedicated to stream mining and online learning, widely used in academic research. 
    * Key Features:
      * Introduced foundational algorithms like Hoeffding Trees, Adaptive Random Forest (ARF), and several drift detection techniques (e.g., DDM, EDDM). 
      * Excellent scalability for handling high-throughput data streams in real-time. 
      * Strong focus on concept drift adaptation, making it robust in non-stationary environments. 
  * capyMOA[@capymoaCapyMOAx2024]
    * Python Interface for MOA: capyMOA serves as a bridge between the Java-based MOA framework and Python, allowing users to leverage MOA's powerful streaming algorithms within Python workflows. 
      * Key Features:
        * Enables access to MOA's core functionalities (e.g., Hoeffding Trees, Adaptive Random Forest) from Python. 
        * Facilitates hybrid workflows by integrating MOA's Java algorithms with Python's machine learning libraries. 
        * Useful for Python developers looking to use MOA's advanced stream mining capabilities without switching ecosystems.

scikit-multiflow and creme (River) focus on efficient online learning in Python, mainly for traditional machine learning algorithms.
MOA offers extensive tools for stream mining but lacks deep learning support and Python compatibility. 
While capyMOA provides Python accessibility to MOA, capyMOA is limited by the underlying Java infrastructure and lacks a natural integration with PyTorchâ€™s deep learning ecosystem.  

`DeepRiver`[@githubGitHubOnlinemldeepriver] differentiates itself by integrating deep learning capabilities directly into streaming data workflows, enabling continuous learning for neural network models. 
This addresses a critical gap left by existing frameworks, which are predominantly focused on non-deep learning models.

It equips practitioners with tools for evaluating the performance of deep learning models on data streams. This feature is crucial for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of models in real-time applications, enabling users to monitor and fine-tune their models as the data evolves.

# Architecture

The `DeepRiver` library is structured around various types of estimators for anomaly detection, classification, and regression.
Each category contains several specialized classes that inherit from more general base classes, forming a hierarchical structure.
In anomaly detection, the base class `AnomalyScaler` has derived classes `AnomalyMeanScaler`, `AnomalyMinMaxScaler`, and `AnomalyStandardScaler`.
Additionally, the `Autoencoder` class, which inherits from `DeepEstimator`, has a specialized subclass called `ProbabilityWeightedAutoencoder`.
The `RollingAutoencoder` class inherits from `RollingDeepEstimator`.

For classification, the base class `Classifier` inherits from `DeepEstimator`.
Derived from `Classifier` are specific classes like `LogisticRegression` and `MultiLayerPerceptron`.
The `RollingClassifier` class inherits from both `RollingDeepEstimator` and `Classifier`.

In regression, the base class `Regressor` inherits from `DeepEstimator`.
Specific regression classes like `LinearRegression` and `MultiLayerPerceptron` inherit from `Regressor`.
The `MultiTargetRegressor` also inherits from `DeepEstimator`.
The `RollingRegressor` class inherits from both `RollingDeepEstimator` and `Regressor`.
